There are several files that contain code I used to create my analysis:

* grid_search.py - Used this to optimize hyperparameters
* hw1_util.py - Contains varius utility methods, and the main method is used to calculate AUC's for the hill-valley dataset
* learning_curve.py - Used to create learning curve plots
* prediction_times.py - Used to measure performance of different algorithms
* spiral.py - Used to measure AUC for two spirals dataset and also creates classification plots
* validation_curve_daboost.py - Validation curves for Adaboost
* validation_curve_dtree.py - Validation curves for Decision Tree
* validation_curve_knn.py - Validation curves for kNN
* validation_curve_nn.py - Validation curves for MLP
* validation_curve_svm.py - Validation curves for SVM
